### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Code enthusiast by heart, especially interested in low-level programming languages. 
Usually working in embedded environments, but also happy to do some backend and android development.

Recently, I also have found an interest in solving code challenges.

Languages I prefer:
  * C++
  * Rust
  * Go
  * Kotlin
